      I'm currently an Assistant Professor at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.christuniversity.in/" target="_blank">CHRIST (Deemed to be University)</a> for department of Computer Science. I graduated PhD from
      <a class="underline-link" href="www.vit.ac.in" target="_blank">VIT University</a> after completing MCA at
      <a class="underline-link" href="" target="_blank">Anna University</a>.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
